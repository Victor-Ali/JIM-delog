Today we are going to continue with our bible reading but before we read shall we just have a moment of prayer father we are asking that you will open our eyes of understanding as read your word today we are asking that relevant passages that really speak to our present need and problems spiritually materially and physically you will impress upon our hearts be with us, lighting us, instructors us, teach us, as we read together now. In Jesus name I pray, we shall continue withthe reading now

"And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee;.... With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation." ( Exodus 23:25. Deuteronomy 7:15. Psalms 91:16 )

You have just listing to the bible reading and we need to take whatever we have learnt to the Lord in prayer, talk to the Lord in prayer, you see the commandments, a warning, an example, an instruction to obey, a promise to claim, pray for grace that you will do as you have learnt in the word of God. In Jesus name I pray. Thank you and God bless you. Amen
