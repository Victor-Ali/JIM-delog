I want to read the promises of God unto you, and every prayer request you brought here, the Lord will answer. “Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old” (Isaiah 43:18). This is not a question, it is an affirmative, what not to do, forget the sorrows, pressures, suffering, tears of the past, a new day has come into your life. Let no man remind you of the failure or suffering of the past. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ” (Ephesians 1:3). All blessings from heavenly places, The Lord is going to shower upon everyone, the Lord has blessed us already, salvation, restoration, holiness, grace, healing, power, authority, is available. It will be confirmed in your life. The Lord is going to translate you from the powers on earth to power in heavenly places. Suffering, enemies, problems will be under your feet. He is going to forgive your sins, save your soul, deliver you from every power of darkness because He is Able. Everything you are asking; the Lord will do beyond that. The power of God will work in every one of us in Jesus Name. "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue” (2 Peter 1:3). You want to personalise this promise that the Lord has given unto us. He has called you to glory and virtue, and everything brining disgrace in your life, He will wipe away from your life. The human nature will be replaced by the divine nature. The human nature is weak, the strength of divine nature will come to you. The human nature is sickly, the health of the divine nature will be given unto you. The human nature is sinful, the holiness and righteousness of the divine nature will be imparted unto you. I will have mine. I will not be disappointed. I will not go away empty handed. A change is coming upon my life tonight. I am reading from Hebrews 11:40 "God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect” (Hebrews 11:40). God has provided better things for you. Better days, things have come into your life from tonight. A rain of blessing, salvation, sanctification, healing, deliverance, victory, of success is coming upon your life and family. I believe. There shall be showers of blessings in Jesus Name. Multiplication has come. He will settle your family life, professional and every area of your life. "And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD." (Ezekiel 36:11) "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts." ( Haggai 2:9 ) "Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these." (John 1:50) greater things will come upon your life in Jesus Name. You will climb higher, you will go greater, and do greater things in Jesus Name.The Lord has promised that He is going to do that, and I believe the promises of God, and they will be fulfilled in our lives in Jesus Name. “And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform” (Romans 4:21). Total deliverance in your life. “But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions” (Obadiah 1:17). You are at Mount Zion at this page 📄, and the Lord will not leave nor forsake us, and there shall be deliverance. This is the day of deliverance, period of deliverance. No yoke, tears, oppression will remain in your life, The Lord will deliver every one tonight. And when God says I will, no one can stop HIM. “Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence” (Psalms 91:2). Surely, He shall deliver me. I see deliverance, healing, salvation, here tonight. No doubt tonight. I love the Lord. “He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions” (Psalms 107:20). The moment the word of God enters into your life, healing will enter into you. You received the word, you receive deliverance and benefit from that deliverance in Jesus Name. “And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible” (Jeremiah 15:21). Wicked people will not terminate your life, will not stop the plan of God for your life in Jesus Name. God will frustrate all their plans against your life. The Lord will deliver me. He has satisfied the demand of the Father for your deliverance. "Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me” (Psalms 119:133). Iniquity, sin, bad habit, sickness, Satan, power of darkness will not have dominion over you. The Lord will make you a new creature, put a new song into your mouth. Your time has come 👆May God bless the reading of His word. God bless you 👋 👋 👋
