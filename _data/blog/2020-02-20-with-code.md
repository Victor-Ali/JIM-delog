You will see God in a new way. He will take over your battle and fight for you. Whatever is standing between you and your destiny shall be pulled down. Encouragement will replace discouragement. Where you have fallen, you will arise and hope will replace hopelessness. God will connect you to your divine helper and you will enjoy a stress less victory. your song shall be Hallelujah In Jesus Mighty Name. God bless you.
